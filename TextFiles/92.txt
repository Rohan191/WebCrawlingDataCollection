CONTENT:b'Tennis\n\n\nNews\nLast Updated: 15/07/17 12:09pmRoger Federer says he is "unbelievably excited" to be back in the Wimbledon final for an incredible 11th time.But Federer says he expects a tough match against the big-serving Marin Cilic, a former US Open winner who has also been in impressive form over the last fortnight.Federer beat Tomas Berdych 7-6 7-6 6-4 in his semi-final on Friday and, on Sunday, the 35-year-old will bid to become the first man to win eight Wimbledon titles and the oldest champion in the Open era.The Australian Open champion is enjoying a remarkable 2017 and says he is hopeful that he has one more big performance in him."It makes me really happy, making history here at Wimbledon," said Federer. "It\'s a big deal, I love this tournament."All my dreams came true here as a player. To have another chance to go for number eight now, be so close at this stage, is a great feeling."I\'m unbelievably excited, I hope I can play one more good match. Eleven finals here, all these records, it\'s great, but it doesn\'t give me the title quite yet."That\'s why I came here this year. I\'m so close now, so I\'ve just got to stay focused."Federer won his seventh title back in 2012 but this is his third time in the final since then, having lost to Novak Djokovic in both 2013 and 2014."I feel I\'m ready for it," he said. "I\'ve played good matches here since my win in 2012."I played great in 2014, 15. I\'m happy I\'m up to that level again."                    Who will win the 2017 Wimbledon men\'s title?                Federer still has not dropped a set but was tested by Berdych and the match might have panned out very differently had just a few points gone the Czech\'s way."I thought it was close," said Federer. "There were chances for the opponent. I was able to come up with the goods when it mattered."I never played with any sense of panic, which is so important when it gets to crunch time."It was a good match. He\'s got power, and so has Marin. So I\'m in for a tough one."We had a brutal quarter-final last year here (when Federer came from two sets down to win) and he crushed me at the US Open in 2014."Things got complicated and I got lucky to win last year. Marin is a great guy and I\'m happy that he\'s in his first Wimbledon final."We will have Wimbledon finals weekend covered via our website skysports.com/tennis then click through to our dedicated section skysports.com/tennis/wimbledon.On the move?
