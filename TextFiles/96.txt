Garbine Muguruza says everything came together for Wimbledon win                The 23-year-old held before driving her forehand long with her own break point chance in the next game.Under the Centre Court roof it was Williams who turned the screw with some juicy groundstrokes to earn two set points. But the Spaniard held steady following a tumultuous 19-shot rally to come through under immense pressure.And Muguruza made Williams pay with a break in the 11th game before delighting her temporary coach for Wimbledon, Martinez, by holding an intensely physical service game to take it 7-5 after 51 minutes of action.A double fault by veteran Williams handed Muguruza a break at the start of the second set as she began to crumble.Two more breaks of Williams' serve followed as Muguruza took a stranglehold of the final as Venus seemed to hit a mental and physical wall and she closed out a bagel set with a successful Hawk-Eye challenge to put the beleaguered American out of her misery.Muguruza will take home a cool \xc2\xa32.2m in prize money, with runner-up Williams, in the Wimbledon final for the first time in eight years, netting \xc2\xa31.1m.We will have the Wimbledon men's final covered via our website skysports.com/tennis then click through to our dedicated section skysports.com/tennis/wimbledon.On the move?
